- not all views/serializers have to be custom (non-REST)
    - you can just use REST and make multiple calls to update the store
    - once things are in the store you can do whatever you want with them
- abstract reducer store updates
    - `component->dispatch(action(type, reducer_space_identifier, payload))`
- break views into merchant/  and broker/ folders and remove Merchant* Broker* prefixes
